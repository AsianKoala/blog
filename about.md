Hi, I'm Neil Mehra, a junior studying computer science at Georgia Tech. 

I am an incoming quantitative developer intern at [Qube Research & Technologies](https://www.qube-rt.com/), 
on the US Markets HFT Team.

My interests lie primarily in low-latency systems and performance tuning. In my free time, I enjoy watching K-Dramas and anime.
