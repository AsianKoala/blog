Hello, my name is Neil Mehra, and I'm currently a freshman studying computer science + math at Stony Brook University.
I originally started this blog out of the desire to document intriguing competitive programming problems I encounter.
Although this blog was created with the intent of being focused on competitive programming, I plan to also write posts on any topics unrelated to CP, if they interest me.
